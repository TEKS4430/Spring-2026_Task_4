# Spring-2026 Task 4 — Arm Control

## Part A


### Overview

This assignment focuses on how autonomous cyber-physical systems execute actions in the physical world through control and actuation. Students implement a control pipeline for a robotic arm in a Webots and ROS 2 environment, exploring how discrete commands are translated into continuous motion. The task covers forward kinematics, PID control for trajectory tracking, and a state-machine-based pick-and-place behavior, highlighting the interaction between modeling, control, and physical constraints. Through this, students gain practical understanding of how perception and decision-making are realized as stable, controlled physical actions.

Setup is familiar from previous assignments:
> **Webots R2025a** runs on your host OS.  
> **ROS2 Jazzy** runs inside Docker.  
> Your code lives in `src/` — edit on host, build and run in container.

---

## Quick start

### 1. First-time setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Linux:        uncomment NETWORK_MODE=host and WEBOTS_HOST=localhost
# Mac/Windows:  leave as-is

docker compose build   # ~5 min first time
```

### 2. Open Webots

1. Open Webots R2025a → **File → Open World** → `worlds/arm_assignment.wbt`
2. Press **Play ▶** before launching the driver

> ⚠️ If you see `"retrying for another 50 seconds..."` — just press Play in Webots.  
> The driver reconnects automatically.

### 3. Start the container and build

```bash
docker compose run --rm ros2 bash
cb && src
```

| Alias | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `cb`  | `colcon build --symlink-install` |
| `src` | `source install/setup.bash` |
| `rt`  | `ros2 topic list` |

### 4. Start the driver (always Terminal 1)

```bash
ros2 launch arm_control_pkg arm.launch.py
```

Confirm the driver loaded — you should see:
```
[YouBotArmDriver] Driver ready — all topics live
```

Then check topics in a second terminal:
```bash
rt | grep youBot
```

You should see `/youBot/arm_joint_1/sensor` through `arm_joint_5/sensor` and `/youBot/end_effector_position`. If you see nothing, the driver is not running.

---

## Task 1 — Forward Kinematics

**Learning goal:** Understand how joint angles map to end-effector position.

```bash
# Terminal 1 — driver (keep open for all tasks)
ros2 launch arm_control_pkg arm.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — FK explorer
ros2 run arm_control_pkg task1_fk
```

Edit `joint_index` and `target_angle` at the bottom of `task1_fk_explorer.py`, then rebuild and run again for each experiment:

```bash
# After editing on your host:
cb && src
ros2 run arm_control_pkg task1_fk
```

### What to record

Fill in this table in your report (run the node once per row):

| Joint | Start (rad) | End (rad) | EE start (x, y, z) | EE end (x, y, z) |
|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 0.0 | 1.0 | | |
| 1 | 0.0 | 2.0 | | |
| 2 | 0.0 | 0.5 | | |
| 2 | 0.0 | 1.0 | | |
| 3 | 0.0 | -1.0 | | |
| 4 | 0.0 | 1.0 | | |

### Hints

- **Wait for values to stop changing** before recording — the arm takes 1–2 seconds to settle after a command.
- **What the axes mean:** `x` is forward (away from the robot body), `y` is sideways, `z` is up. All values are relative to the arm's base joint.
- **Which joints do what:** Joint 1 rotates the base (changes x and y, z stays the same). Joints 2 and 3 control how far forward and how high the arm reaches. Joints 4 and 5 control wrist angle.
- **The workspace question (Task 1b):** Think about what the arm is physically attached to, and what that means about positions directly below or behind it.

---

## Task 2 — PID Controller (Sine Wave Tracking)

**Learning goal:** Implement and tune a PID controller. Observe how each term affects tracking.

Joint 2 follows a continuously moving sine wave target. Your controller must keep the arm tracking it. Watch the arm in Webots — tracking visibly improves with each term you add.

### Workflow — one run at a time

```bash
# Terminal 1 — driver (keep open across all runs)
ros2 launch arm_control_pkg arm.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — your PID controller
ros2 run arm_control_pkg task2_pid

# Terminal 3 — data logger (saves plot automatically on Ctrl+C)
ros2 run arm_control_pkg data_logger --ros-args -p label:=P_only
```

Run for ~60 seconds (3 full cycles), then Ctrl+C both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3.

Repeat with labels `PD` and `PID`. When you stop the logger it automatically saves the comparison plot to:
```
src/arm_control_pkg/logs/task2_plot.png
```
Open that file directly on your host machine — no display needed in Docker.

### What to implement

Open `task2_pid_joint.py` and find the TODO section in `_control_loop`. Implement in order:

**Task 2a — P term only** (`Ki=0, Kd=0`):
```python
correction = Kp * error
```
The arm will start following the sine wave but lag behind the target.

**Task 2b — Add D term** (keep your Kp):
```python
derivative = (error - self.prev_error) / self.dt
correction = Kp * error + Kd * derivative
```
The lag should reduce. Watch the arm in Webots become more responsive.

**Task 2c — Add I term** (keep your Kp and Kd):
```python
self.integral += error * self.dt
correction = Kp * error + Kd * derivative + Ki * self.integral
```
Any remaining constant offset between arm and target should disappear.

### Hints

- **With `correction = 0.0`** (before you implement anything), the arm sends `target + 0 = target` — it will move, but it is not using any feedback. The error will be non-zero and visible in the log. This is expected.
- **Starting gain values:** `Kp = 1.0` is a good starting point. If the arm barely moves, increase it. If it oscillates wildly, decrease it.
- **Keep Kd small** (0.01–0.05). The D term amplifies sensor noise — too large and the arm will vibrate rather than dampen.
- **Keep Ki small** (0.01–0.1). The I term accumulates over time — too large causes slow growing oscillations.
- **Each run must be independent** — stop Terminal 2 (controller) and Terminal 3 (logger) with Ctrl+C before starting the next run. Use a different `label` each time so the plot shows all three curves.

## Task 3 — Pick and Place State Machine

**Learning goal:** Implement a discrete state machine and observe the gap between discrete decisions and continuous arm dynamics.

The arm must complete this sequence:
```
HOME → APPROACH → GRASP → CLOSE_GRIP → LIFT
```

```bash
# Terminal 1 — driver
ros2 launch arm_control_pkg arm.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — state machine
ros2 run arm_control_pkg task3_pick
```

### What to implement

Open `task3_pick_place.py` and implement the two methods:

**`_send_joint_commands(state)`** — publish target angles to all 5 joints:
```python
for i in range(5):
    msg = Float64()
    msg.data = STATE_ANGLES[state][i]
    self.joint_pubs[i].publish(msg)
```

**`_check_transition(state)`** — return `True` only when safe to advance:
```python
# Condition 1: all joints close enough to target
all_close = all(
    abs(self.current_angles[i] - STATE_ANGLES[state][i]) < POSITION_THRESHOLD
    for i in range(5)
)
# Condition 2: arm has held that position for DWELL_TIME seconds
if all_close:
    if self.dwell_start is None:
        self.dwell_start = time.time()
    return time.time() - self.dwell_start >= DWELL_TIME
else:
    self.dwell_start = None
    return False
```

### Run it twice

Edit `DWELL_TIME` at the top of the file:

| Run | Setting | Expected behaviour |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | `DWELL_TIME = 0.0` | Arm skips states before finishing motion |
| 2 | `DWELL_TIME = 1.5` | Each state completes before the next begins |

Rebuild between runs: `cb && src`

### Adjusting STATE_ANGLES for your setup

The provided `STATE_ANGLES` are approximate. **The arm may not reach the box exactly** — this is normal and part of the task. To improve the arm's reach:

1. **Use Task 1's FK explorer** to find angles that position the EE near your box:
   - Run `task1_fk` with different joint angles
   - Look at the EE `x` and `z` values — aim to match the box position visually
   - Joint 2 (shoulder, `arm_joint_2`) primarily controls height (z)
   - Joint 3 (elbow, `arm_joint_3`) primarily controls forward reach (x) — use negative values to extend forward
   - Joint 4 (wrist, `arm_joint_4`) fine-tunes the approach angle

2. **Update `STATE_ANGLES`** in `task3_pick_place.py` with your found angles:
   - `APPROACH` should position the EE a few centimetres **above** the box
   - `GRASP` should position the EE at the box level
   - `LIFT` should raise the arm back up

3. **You can also move the box** in the Webots Scene Tree to a position that's easier to reach — click the TARGET_BOX node, change its `translation` field.

> The arm's maximum forward reach is approximately **0.46 m** from its base joint (which is offset ~0.16 m from the robot centre). The box must be within this range.

## Troubleshooting

**No `/youBot/...` topics after launch**  
→ Driver not loaded. Check Webots is open and simulation is playing ▶.

**`angle=0.000` never changes in task2**  
→ Driver must be running in a separate terminal. `task2_pid` alone does nothing — it needs the driver running in Terminal 1 simultaneously.

**Arm doesn't move in Task 3 / stuck on HOME forever**  
→ `_send_joint_commands` is not implemented yet (it's `pass`). Implement it first — without it, no commands are published and the arm never moves.

**Segmentation fault when stopping the driver (Ctrl+C)**  
→ Known bug in `webots_ros2_driver`. Safe to ignore — driver shuts down correctly.

**`rcl_shutdown already called` on Ctrl+C**  
→ Cosmetic only. Safe to ignore.

**Changes not taking effect**  
→ Run `cb && src` after every edit. Always rebuild before testing.

**Container can't connect to Webots (Mac/Windows)**  
→ Check `.env` has `WEBOTS_HOST=host.docker.internal`.

**Mac Apple Silicon — build fails**  
→ Docker Desktop → Settings → General → enable "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation".
